# UofM Bootcamp Challenge 3 - Password Generator

## Description

We were given a pre-built webpage for a password generator, with the instructions to prompt the user for whether they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters included in the password. They also are required to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters. If they answer no to all options of what to include, the questions cycle back to the beginning and repeat.

The original code is located at https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota/UofM-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC-ENTG/-/tree/main/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge

The password generator is deployed at https://dbrainz.github.io/password-gen/
